it can be seen that the model is performing fairly accurately to capture the physics of the problem if the differential equations are known to us.
we have used the traditional boundary loss terms and residual loss terms but for the x=1 conditions we have defined new loss as mse(difference in 
fluxes, 0)+ mse(difference is predicted temperature, 0) this loss needs to be enforced strictly to ensure continuity and hence we enforce a hard 
penalty as compared to all the other losses. 

it can be noted that if we vary the number of collocation points, the residual loss is less and hence the physics can be relaxed a bit leading to 
some deviation with the actual solution. 

the actual solution is:

u1(x) = 100/101 x
u2(x) = 10000/101 x - 9900/101 

which gives the interface temperature to be 0.99 ~ 1.
